# SC_Profiler - Discord-Bot
A simple Discord bot with automated web scraping to retrieve a player's profile and organization data. Built for use within the Star Citizen community.

SCProfiler is a Discord slash‑command bot built in Node.js that retrieves Star Citizen (RSI) profile and organization information by scraping public RSI citizen pages.
It integrates Discord.js, Cheerio, and node-fetch to collect and format data directly inside Discord.

Fetches:
• 	RSI profile link 
• 	Main organization (name, SID, type) 
• 	All affiliated organizations (name, SID, rank, link) 
• 	Validates whether the RSI profile exists 
• 	Clean, formatted Discord responses 
• 	Graceful error handling 
• 	Command for controlled bot termination 
• 	Uses environment variables for secure token handling 

This makes the project a practical example of:
• 	Web scraping
• 	DOM parsing
• 	API‑less data extraction
• 	Discord bot development

🛠️ Technologies Used
• 	Node.js
• 	Discord.js v14
• 	Cheerio (HTML scraping)
• 	node-fetch
• 	dotenv
